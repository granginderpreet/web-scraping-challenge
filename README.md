app.py: top level flask application that is setting up routes for home and scrapping

scrape_mars.py: python script that is called when we call the scrape() route from flask

templates/index.html: Main HTML page for website
templates/Mars_facts.html: Table generated by scraping in form of a webpage. Output from this html page was copied into index.html. Had to manually copy it but could eventaully load the content using javscript.
